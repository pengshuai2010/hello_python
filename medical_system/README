For the simplicity of testing, the program is one-shot. That means you can prepare test inputs in a text file and feed it to the program.
There some sample tests in the folder 'tests'. Run thos tests by redirecting stdin. For example:
python medical_system/__init__.py < tests/display_patients_summaries.txt

# known issues
When input the start date and end date of insurance coverage, the program doesn't check that the end date is after the start date.
